# Stock-Price-Predictor
Predicting stock price using machine learning

This project is a simple stock price predictor that uses historical stock price data and a linear regression model to make predictions. The code is implemented in Python, leveraging the scikit-learn library for machine learning.

Features
Data Loading: The project includes a function to load historical stock price data from a CSV file.

Data Preprocessing: The data preprocessing function extracts relevant features and prepares the data for model training.

Model Training: The code uses a linear regression model to train on historical stock price data.

Prediction: After training, the model makes predictions on a test set, and the results are visualized.

Evaluation: Performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared are calculated to evaluate the model.

Metrics Display: The project includes a function to display and print the evaluation metrics.

Plotting: Results, including actual and predicted stock prices, are plotted for visualization.

Prediction for New Data: Users can make predictions for new data by providing additional input.
